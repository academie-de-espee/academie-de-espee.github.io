title: It's just a scratch

Flesh wounds, blood loss, and how we treat them on the field is a
tricky subject.  Rather than approaching this topic from a scientific
viewpoint, (ie. why people tend to feel faint after losing this amount
of blood) I would like to talk about how it looks to anyone watching the
fight.

Blow calling is the singular most difficult aspect of our martial art.
Proper blow calling requires making small distinctions amidst the heat
of battle, as well as keeping our egos in check. (Of course, none of us
has ever had any trouble with an over inflated ego, right?)  More
importantly, blow calling directly reflects on how honorable we are
held, both on and off the field.  You can be the most chivalrous person
on the face of this earth, but a reputation of a rhino hide precedes all
others.  Compounding this challenge to call your blows well, is the
element of blood loss and minor wounds.

When would you lose consciousness from blood loss, or when would flesh
wounds be too painful for you to continue?  Those are personal questions
that I do not intend to try to answer.  I only wish to point out how
stupid a fighter looks when he staggers around for five minutes holding
his side trying to continue the fight.  Either you are wounded or you
are not.  If you are not seriously wounded, don't confuse your opponent
and the marshals by hamming it up if you don't intend to admit to blood
loss or pain.  If you are wounded, give yourself a specific time limit
to finish the bout.  If you can't finish it in that time, yield.

Only you can call your wounds, that is the great strength of the
fighting that we do.  However, it is important to keep in mind that you
are fighting in public, and people are watching.  A reputation is made
or broken on what they see.  We are fighting to display our honor and
that includes our overall actions on the field.  Someone who
consistently ignores flesh wounds, or even acknowledges a non-killing
cut, but continues to fight as if they have the stamina of Hercules
looks like an idiot, or worse.

I am not saying that you should yield if you get a scratch, or a nick.
I am saying that while a draw cut to the side of the head, or your side
may not kill you, the time you can continue fighting is limited.  The
more you stretch that limit, the more you risk your reputation.

Every time a fighter steps onto the list field, he should reaffirm a
decision to him or herself.  Which is more important, the win, or my
reputation?  If its the win, you don't belong in this game.
