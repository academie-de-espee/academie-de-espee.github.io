title: Guidelines for Consideration
---


Greetings Atlantian Rapier fighters...

For sometime now, people have been asking for some indicator of what is
required to advance in the Academie d'Espee to Free Scholar, and also what is
looked for in a potential candidate for White Scarf.  After much discussion,
the White Scarves have decided to present to you the general guidelines found
below.  Note that we did *NOT*  seek to create a list of endeavours to be
treated as a "checklist".  It was unanimously decided that it is
counterproductive to create such a list.  What we did use/alter were the
Corpora guidelines for Peers of the SCA.  We felt that they were comprehensive
in their coverage and well written.  You'll note that the below list of
guidelines is a list of duties a Provost/FS should fullfill.

When these guidelines are used to evaluate the possibility of asking a person to be a Free Scholar, the
evaluation will be skewed to reflect that. The only difference from a Provost is the level of skill of
the peer group and the degree of effort expected in showing skill, courtesy, teaching and honor.

Remember that Provosts are made solely at the discretion of TRM Atlantia. While the Crowns do solicit the
opinions of the current members of the Order, like all other Atlantian Orders of Merit, it is TRM that
make the final decision.

Also recall that Free scholars are made solely at the discretion of 3 agreeing Provosts.  Again, while
they do solicit the opinions of the other Provosts, Free Scholars and even non-Academie members, it is
that triad that makes the final decision.

We hope that these guidelines are satisfactory.  We realize that not everyone will be satisfied by what they'll find below, but it's what we deemed best.  Any comments can be made to your local White Scarf, or Giacomo Vincente (FS Headmaster), or myself which I will pass onto the rest of the Provosts.  Please don't ask us to make a checklist, cause it WON'T happen ;-P.

I hope this finds you well,

In service,

Gunther van Drakenburg
