If I could offer you only one tip for the future, armour would be it. The 
long-term benefits of armour have been proven by Dukes, whereas the 
rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering 
experience. 
  <BR><BR>
I will dispense this advice now...
  <BR><BR>
Enjoy the power and beauty of your sword. Oh, never mind.. You will not 
understand the power and beauty of your sword until it's mushed into a 
broom. But, trust me, in twenty rounds you'll look back at pictures of 
yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility 
lay before you and how fabulous you really looked.
  <BR><BR>
You are not as fat as you imagine...
  <BR><BR>
Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective 
as trying to block a Duke's axe by screaming in fear. The real blows that 
end the fights are apt to be the things that you never saw, the kind that
blind side you around your shield.. 
  <BR><BR>
Do one thing in every bout that scares you.. 
  <BR><BR>
Sing...
  <BR><BR>
Don't be reckless with other people's ribcages. Don't put up with people 
who are reckless with yours... 
  <BR><BR>
"Light..."
  <BR><BR>
Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're 
behind. The bout is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself... and 
with that guy trying to cave your skull in.. 
  <BR><BR>
Remember the compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in 
doing this, tell me how.. 
  <BR><BR>
Keep your old helms. Throw away your old swords.. 
  <BR><BR>
Stretch...
  <BR><BR>
Don't feel guilty if you don't know how to fight your opponent. The most 
interesting Counts are still surprised they won. The very most interesting 
Dukes didn't know how to fight all their opponents either.. 
  <BR><BR>
Get plenty of calcium. 
  <BR><BR>
Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone. 
  <BR><BR>
Maybe you'll win, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll be crowned, maybe you won't. 
Maybe you'll get knocked out in the first round, maybe you'll be in finals. 
Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself 
either. You blows are half chance. So are everyone else's.. 
  <BR><BR>
Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don't be afraid of it or of what 
other people think of it. It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own...
  <BR><BR>
Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but on your fallen opponent.. 
  <BR><BR>
Read the rules of the list, even if you are illiterate.. 
  <BR><BR>
Do not read the Order of Precedence. It will only make you feel outclassed. 
  <BR><BR>
Get to know your Crown. You never know when they'll be gone for good.  Be 
nice to your Baron. They're your best link to your Crown.. 
  <BR><BR>
Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should 
hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because,
as Crown, you'll see more geography and lifestyles than you ever imagined.. 
  <BR><BR>
Live in Atlantia once, but leave before it makes you invulnerable to 
normal blows. 
  <BR><BR>
Live in the Northern Outlands once, but leave before you start accepting 
near misses as killing shots.. 
  <BR><BR>
Accept some inalienable truths: Tournaments always run longer than expected. 
Feasts will be late. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll  fantasize
that when you were young, tournaments were reasonable, feasts were 
on time, and children respected the Crown.. 
  <BR><BR>
Respect your Crown.. 
  <BR><BR>
Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a squire. Maybe 
you have a consort. But it's you standing on the list field. 
  <BR><BR>
Don't mess too much with your helm or by the time you're 40, it will be
40 gauge. 
  <BR><BR>
Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply 
it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the 
past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and 
recycling it for more than it's worth.. 
  <BR><BR>
But trust me on the armour...
