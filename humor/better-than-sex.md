title: Why Fencing Is Better Than Sex
---

* Even ugly fencers score regularly.
* In fencing you have a coach to tell you what you're doing wrong, and you get to practice first before trying it out for real.
* You can fence with strangers without getting a bad reputation and you don't have to spend $30 in the bar getting to know them first.
* You are not being insulting if you insist that your partner wear a mask.
* No one expects a fencing bout to last much longer than two minutes and you don't have to worry afterwards if the other fencer enjoyed it or not.
* In fencing, you don't have to get your own equipment until you decide you like it.
* You usually fence in a big, brightly lit room with lots of people in it.
* The person you're fencing with won't mind if your buddies stand around and cheer for you.
* It doesn't hurt if someone steps on your foil.
* It is almost impossible to catch a disease from a fencing foil.
* You can play with your foil in public and no one will laugh.
* If your foil gets a funny bend in it, all you have to do is run it under your foot.
* No one cares how long your foil is, and if it breaks you just go get a new one.
* It is easy to get pretty girls to hold on to your foil.
* Finally, and perhaps most significantly, in fencing, if your opponent doesn't come, you win.
