*By Master Robin of Gilwell*

There was something his love life was needing,<BR>
Which he tried to discover by reading.<BR>
	The results weren't too classy,<BR>
	For the book was di Grassi --<BR>
With his shoulder he's now always leading.<BR>

Was it really all that much a crime?<BR>
The five principles he thought divine.<BR>
	So he leads with a thrust<BR>
	(As the book says he must)<BR>
And his actions are all done in time.<BR>

So we should not cheer or abuse him<BR>
Says the lady who likes to amuse him.<BR>
	For she loves the cute twist<BR>
	Of the cloak 'round his wrist<BR>
(But the Florentine chapters confuse him).<BR>

This Italian lad loved what he learned,<BR>
So to Silver's slim volume he turned.<BR>
	But it said that his tool<BR>
	Was too long, as a rule.<BR>
(George Silver -- that's one book he burned!)<BR>

He plied his new skills with great flair,<BR>
So he thought it distinctly unfair<BR>
	That she gave hm the bird,<BR>
	For it seems she preferred<BR>
The new French skills of old Sainct-Didier.<BR>

Then she had a most interesting notion --<BR>
To a Spaniard she gave her devotion,<BR>
	For his moves were precise,<BR>
	And his footwork was nice,<BR>
And she loves all the circular motion.<BR>

Then to London she went on her way<BR>
And they held a great challenge that day.<BR>
	There were stars in her eyes<BR>
	As the men played the Prize,<BR>
For the lady was prizing the play.<BR>

So take heed of this lesson, young nipper,<BR>
And use points, not this new-fangled zipper.<BR>
	Let your research be right<BR>
	For the ladies' delight,<BR>
And let's go win one for Agripper!<BR>
