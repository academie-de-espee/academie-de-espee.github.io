These are the rules of rapier combat for the Kingdom of Atlantia, as set out in the
<A HREF = "http://law.atlantia.sca.org/" TARGET="_blank">Kingdom Book Of Policy</A>
(specifically in the
<A HREF = "http://law.atlantia.sca.org/abop02-07.html#3" TARGET="_blank">Policies of the Kingdom Marshal</A>
section).  The format of the Book of Policy is such that *all* martial activities are intermingled, with
authorization policies for all combat forms listed, then weapons and armor standards for all forms, then
conventions for all forms, etc...
<BR><BR>
The copy provided here is not the official copy.  It is, however, organized to just show the
sections that pertain to rapier combat.  In case of dispute, the official source is the published
hard copy from either the <I>Acorn</I> or most recent printing of the Kingdom Book of Policies
(formerly known as the <I>Red Tape</I>).  The official numbering of the rules is based on that copy.
<BR><BR>
It may be downloaded, printed and distributed freely, for the purpose of supporting
the advance of the Art of Defence.
<BR><BR>
<B>These rules are current as of the October, 2002 Acorn printing</B>
<BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://marshal.atlantia.sca.org/Rules/Archery.html" TARGET="_blank">Combat Archery Rules and Regulations</A>
