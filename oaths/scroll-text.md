Be it knowne to alle persons by these present writings wheresoever they shall come to be read, heard or overwise understanded, and especially to alle officers and subjects under our dominion that we, _ & _ , dread sovereigns of alle Atlantian lands, are pleased to certify to them that it is our will to admit the most good and true of men, _ , as Provost in our Academie d'Espee. Know that he has proven right worthie in honor and service, of sufficient cunning and skill in the exercise of civil combat and hath shown as much in tryal by arms with diverse other Provosts of the Academie.  Above all we, on this _ day of _ , A.S. _ find him an honourable soul unto whom we entrust the nurture of this noble art and, with it, the defense of our lands.
