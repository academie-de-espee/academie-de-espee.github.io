{"name":"Academie de Espee","tagline":"Welcome","body":"The Academie d'Espee exists to promote the practice and enjoyment of period style combat with the rapier and related weapons as well as service to both Atlantian Rapier and the Kingdom of Atlantia. Period style includes the use of sixteenth-century fencing techniques, fighting dress and demeanor (on and off the field) and the development of personae appropriate for an individual practicing the rapier in the later period. Service to Atlantian Rapier includes promoting such activities as tournaments and classes. Service to the Kingdom of Atlantia includes pursuing such activities as would benefit the Kingdom beyond those normally expected of an individual.\r\n\r\n## Roster of Members\r\n\r\n* [Masters](https://op.atlantia.sca.org/op_award.php?award_id=902)\r\n* [Provosts](https://op.atlantia.sca.org/op_award.php?award_id=20)\r\n* [Free Scholars](https://freescholars.atlantia.sca.org/)\r\n* Scholars (TBD)\r\n\r\n[Guidelines for Consideration](/guidelines.htm)\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n* [Articles from the Academie](/north.htm)\r\n* [Sacred Oaths](/south.htm)\r\n* [Pennsic Tourney Pageantry](/east.htm)\r\n* [Atlantian Laws, Treaties and Rules](/west.htm)\r\n* [Articles from other Kingdoms](/observatory.htm)\r\n* [Lighter reading](/lounge.htm)\r\n* [Art related to the Academie](/gallery.htm)\r\n* [External Links](/links.htm)\r\n\r\n## Other sites of Interest\r\n* [Rapier Marshal's Site](https://rapier.atlantia.sca.org/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
