  If you don't recognize the origin of this one, there's something wrong with you. *G*  An
  unknown individual did a Squire adaptation of this Monty Python sketch.  I took the
  liberty of changing it slightly to fit our Arte.  Hope you enjoy it...

</TR>

<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%></TD>
  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%>Yes, you stunned him just as he was waking up. Cadets stun easily, you know.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%>Now look , don't play the slippery fella with me, that cadet is 
  definitely deceased, and when purchasing him not half an hour ago you assured me that his total lack
  of movement was due to him being tired and worn out after a long night on the beer.</TD>
  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%></TD>
  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%>Well he's pining for the battle.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%>Pining for the battle, what kind of talk is that? And why did<BR>
  he fall flat on his back the moment I got him to my castle?</TD>
  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%></TD>
  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%>The Midland Blue prefers kipping on his back. Remarkable Cadet, eh 
good Don? Beautiful physique...</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%>Look tosh! I took the liberty of examining this cadet when I got 
home and the only reason he was upright was due to a Del Tin up his backside.</TD>
  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%></TD>
  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%>Of course he had a Del Tin up his back.  If I hadn't put it there,
  he would have been straight over your castle walls.  <B><I>*points away*</I></B> Vroom!!!!!</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%>Vroom?</TD>

  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%>Vroom!</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%>Mate, this cadet wouldn't vroom if you stuck a red hot
  poker up his bum. He's bleeding demised! </TD>
  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%></TD>
  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%>No, no, he's pining...</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=50%>He's not pining, he's..., he's past on. This cadet
  is no more. He has ceased to be, he has expired and gone to meet his maker. He is a 
  stiff. Bereft of life, he rests in peace. If you hadn't nailed him to his horse, he'd
  be pushing up the daisies. He's off the boil. He's curled up his tootsies, he's shuffled
  off this mortal coil, he's run down the curtain to join the bleeding choir invisible. He's
  f*cking snuffed it. Viz a vi the metabolic processes, he's had his lot. All statements to
  the effect that this cadet is still a going concern are from now on inoperative.
  This is an Ex-Cadet!</TD>
